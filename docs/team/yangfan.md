##### Main Functions Implemented
I am mainly responsible for the monitoring of power usage of all Appliances within SmartHomeBot. Which consists of: 

###### *Data*
- Power: Data which stores as appliance's status and its power consumption usage.

###### *Logic*
- Usage : Command to compute and display total power consumption usage. 
- Reset : Command to reset all previous recorded power consumption usage.     
    
The functionalities and manipulation of above mentioned are under my responsibilities, I will have to seek feedbacks from my fellow teammates for bugs and functionalities requests. 

#### Enhancements implemented
I implemented the Usage command which will record and monitor the actual usage according to the Local System Time from the Machine, this will give an accurate usage from real life. Upon user leaving the program, all appliances will be turn off asn stop its monitoring as program was terminated.

#### Contributions to the DeveloperGuide: 
Write up about the introduction and appendix of SmartHomeBot, in charge of overall styling and alignments of the contents and diagrams. Provided Sequence Diagrams for the Architecture, Overview with example, UI, Usage Command and Reset Command. Also, provide class diagram for TextUi.  

#### Review/mentoring contributions:

I also actively take part in reviewing my teammates code through GitHub:
* [Pull Request 1](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/31)
* [Pull Request 2](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/223)

In addition, we often meet up on Zoom and other communication channels. I will be the one who takes care of admin issues and note down the to do list for the team.

#### Contributions beyond the project team:

I also actively take part in other group's project development by reviewing their program for tutorials and PE dry runs.
